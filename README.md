# X airline

This project started around 2015 and I have rewrite this many times as my own learning journey. There are a lot of anti-best-practice code here that I did in the early days. 

The UI is by far the worst cause I am really new to frontend development and it is alreayd a miracle that I made it work!

That said, feel free to correct me on anything. Part of this project is to allow me to know frontend which is never my comfront zone.
